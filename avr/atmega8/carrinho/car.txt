e = setpoint - measured_location.

Proportional control: P is a constant that you detirmine through testing.

control_output = P*e.

Derivative control: You can aproximate the derivative by calculating the difference between the newest error sample and the previous error sample. derivative(e) = e - previous_e.
D is another constant that you detirmine through testing.

PD controller:
control_output = P*e + D*derivative(e)
